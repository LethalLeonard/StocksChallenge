# StocksChallenge
I went harder than I had to.


I had an in-class challege where I had to take the user's input on how many stocks were purchase, at what price, how many stocks were sold and at what price. Using this information we had to generate how much was paid, how much commission was paid at purchase, how much was earned when the stocks were sold, the total commision at selling. Also we had to calculate the profit of from selling, if it was wise to sell, and finally how many stocks remain and their value
